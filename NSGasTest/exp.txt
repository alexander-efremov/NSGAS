Intel Core i5 Work
Before Mu was precomputated in seq:
Seq:2.55 s
Par:1.01 s
Rel:2.52 s

After Mu was precomputated in seq:
Seq:1.70
Par:1.00
Rel:1.68

ICPC Seq optimized (Mu was precomputated)
1.70 s
ICPC Par optimized Openmp have't been linked
2.24 s ??? Dynamic Arrays?
ICPC Par optimized 1 thread
